# How to contribute

After you have made all changes in your local setup, you need to copy and paste modified files inside ```./build-files/suitecrm``` and match the directory structure. 

For example: if you are modifying ```<local-directory>/suitecrm/public/legacy/modules/Accounts/views/view.detail.php`` you need to match the same directory structure inside ```./build-files/suitecrm``` and paste the modified file there.

Commit your changes, push them to the repository and create a pull request.
